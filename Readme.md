# Remove CCF Table from SF Fonts

Scripts for convert otf to ttf for specific font (like SF Pro). `RemoveCCFTable` removes CCF table in OpenType files, so that software like typst can export PDF with correctly subsetted glyphs and you don't get a bloated PDF file (which includes all the characters even if you don't use them).

The script also modifies all the metadata in the font so your system won't confuse the font with the original one.

## Some known issues

- Different variation of the same glyph is not subsetted. For example, if you use `a`, all style variations of `a` will be included in the Typst exported PDF. If you want to reduce the PDF size to the minimum possible, use other font subsetting tools on the produced ttf file.
